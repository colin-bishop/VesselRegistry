# VesselRegistry
Slowly but surely creating a registry of every fishing vessel I can find, collating duplicate sources for completeness where possible and visualizing parameters of interest. Dataset will not be contained within the repo but will be available as it develops. 

## Data Fields
The Universal Vessel Register contains the following datatypes.
|  Vessel Field  | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Unique Vessel ID | The UVID is auto-generated for all unique vessel entries. Who knows how this will play out, what happens if a vessel changes hands or a shell company changes names? Doing my best here folks|
| Vessel Name | If consistent naming is applied, I'll cite that here |
| Gear Type | Might need to rethink this where licenses pertain to gear types |
| Hold Volume  | Units of m^3 |
| Days Fished 2021 | This is going to be tough to nail down. AIS datasets? |
| LOA | Units of Meters  |
| Carrying Capacity  | Tons (t)  |
| National Registration Number  |  |
| Registered Flag |  |
| International Registration Number |  |
| Intl Reg. Authority |  |
| MMSI | Unique ID for AIS transmitter, can vary if radio is moved between vessels |
| Year Built | |
| Home Port | |
|Previous Vessel Name||
|Operator||
|Owner||
|Callsign||
|Vessel Type|Fishing, Transhipment, oiler etc.|
